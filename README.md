# Hybrid Cloud Digital Twin

> Performance simulator for Manila → AWS Singapore hybrid architectures

## Goal

Predict tail latencies (p50/p95/p99) for hybrid cloud systems before deployment.

## What This Does

- Visual topology designer (drag-and-drop)
- Physics-based simulation using queueing theory
- Accurate performance predictions validated against real AWS
- Bottleneck identification

## Status

**Current Phase:** Research & Learning

## Next Steps

1. Study queueing theory (M/M/1 queues)
2. Build CLI proof-of-concept simulator
3. Collect calibration data from Manila → AWS Singapore
4. Validate simulation accuracy against real deployment
